ðŸ”¥ Slide 1: Cover Slide
Logo + Name: Plasma MXI


Tagline: Mixed Intelligence for a Living Future


Founder: Chad Curll | plasmamxi.com



ðŸ§¬ Slide 2: What is Plasma MXI?
A civilizational nervous system â€” integrating machine, biological, emotional, and ecological intelligence.
We're building the infrastructure for adaptive, intelligent systems


Each domain is represented by a Stack: modular, powerful, interoperable



ðŸ’¡ Slide 3: Why Now?
AI alone isnâ€™t enough â€” the future is Mixed Intelligence


Climate volatility, system fragility, and collapse signals demand interoperable infrastructure


We're in a window where foundational bets become planetary leverage



ðŸ§± Slide 4: What Weâ€™re Building
12 Stacks, each representing a key domain of civilizational function


MVPs already active in:


âš¡ Fusion (LENR optimization tools)


ðŸ¤– Souls (biorobotics + control logic)


ðŸ’“ Loosh (emotional state AI)


ðŸ›¡ Exercitus Caelestis (ethical defense systems)



ðŸ“ˆ Slide 5: Progress & Infrastructure
Repos live: github.com/MixedIntelligence


Codex, Protocols, and Governance models written


Loosh + Souls integrated


Early roadmap for all 12 core Stacks in progress



ðŸ’° Slide 6: The Ask
We are seeking early capital to complete MVPs, scale the core team, and prepare Stack spinouts.
$750k â€“ $1.5M pre-seed


Use of funds:


Finalize Fusion MVP + testbed


Build Souls hardware prototype


Fund Loosh + Kassandra integrations


Team (roboticist, ML engineer, embedded dev, ops lead)



ðŸ§  Slide 7: The Founder
Chad Curll
Systems thinker, visionary, ritual engineer


Embedded in Boston innovation ecosystems (MIT, The Engine, etc.)


Builder of tech with symbolic and strategic depth



ðŸŒŒ Slide 8: The Vision
We donâ€™t optimize. We integrate.
 We donâ€™t just build apps. We build the nervous system for post-fragile civilization.
Mixed Intelligence is the substrate of the next era


Youâ€™re not just funding a startup â€” youâ€™re helping compose the world to come
